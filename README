Setting up and running the Rails app
====================================

I. Getting the necessary gems (libraries)

a) Run "bundle install"

b) Install imagemagick (used to resize the uploaded story images)
- run "brew install imagemagick"

Database setup

a) Install PostgreSQL database
- run `brew install postgres`
- follow any instructions afterwards for starting it

b) Create a proper config/database.yml file
- Copy config/database.yml.template to config/database.yml and change the username to your postgres user (usually your computer username, mine was djbrowning)
- Create your local database by running "rake db:create"

c) Migrate your database
- Run `rake db:migrate`
- (you'll do this any time there are changes to the database, which happens when you see new files under db/migrations)

d) Setup SOLR indexer (for searching stories)
- run `rake sunspot:solr:start`

II. Testing the code

a) Run all tests
- Run `rake test` which, by default, runs all tests in the app

b) To run a specific test
- Run `ruby -Itest [path_to_test_file.rb]`, e.g. `ruby -Itest test/integration/signup_test.rb`

III. Running the app

a) Make sure your postgres database is running

b) Run `rails s` to start the web server
