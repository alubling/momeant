Setting up the app locally
==========================

Database setup

a) Install PostgreSQL database
- if you don't have Homebrew, get it: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew
- run "brew install postgres"
- follow any instructions afterwards for starting it

b) Create a proper config/database.yml file
- Copy config/database.yml.template to config/database.yml and change the username to your postgres user (usually your computer username)
- Create the proper databases by running "rake db:create:all"

c) Migrate your database
- Run "rake db:migrate"
- (you'll do this any time there are changes to the database, which happens when you see new files under db/migrations)


Getting the necessary gems (libraries)

a) Run "bundle install"


Testing the code

a) Run all tests
- Run "rake test" which, by default, runs all tests in the app

b) To run a specific test
- Run "ruby test/path_to_test_file.rb", e.g. "ruby test/integration/homepage_tests.rb"


Running the app

a) Make sure your postgres database is running

b) Run "rails s" to start the web server


Running the ruby console

a) Make sure your postgres database is running

b) Run "rails c" to start the console
