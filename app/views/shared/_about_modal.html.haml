          %section
            %h3 Every day, we enjoy great content made by real people all over the world.
            %p They're posting work, telling interesting stories, and sharing valuable knowledge with us on the Web.
          %section
            %h3 So what's the problem? Creators need our support.
            %p Imagine a Web where content creators have the chance to get paid for their work, and creativity and knowledge equal real value. Momeant is a community for connecting with and supporting people doing great work online.

          %h1 The Momeant Principles
          %section.bulleted.people
            %h3 People, not projects.
            %p For people already doing and sharing great work on the Web, who want to form lasting relationships with their audiences, Momeant is creating a close knit community of support.
          %section.bulleted.flag
            %h3 Free for all.
            %p All creators on Momeant share their work for free. We strongly believe that information can't be kept locked up, but that creators who make the work we enjoy and value should have the opportunity to get support.
          %section.bulleted.star
            %h3 Reward what matters to you.
            %p See something you like? Show support with a reward. Rewards build ongoing connections between creators and supporters, and show the community what you value, helping them discover new creators.

          %h1 How it works
          %section
            %h3 Start by finding some interesting creators to follow.
            %p Don't see someone you like, or are you a creator yourself? #{mail_to "team@momeant.com", "Email and tell us."}
          %section
            %h3 See some great work? Reward the creator.
            %p You become a supporter of creators you care about, receive updates from them, follow their work, and connect with them directly.  
          %section
            %h3 Hereâ€™s the bottom line
            %p We want to imagine a Web community where anyone sharing creativity and knowledge can exchange it for real value. Take the first step and join us.
