    Nice work! This is where everyone else can reward you.

      %p You have pledged #{number_to_currency(current_user.pledged_amount)} in rewards. That's awesome!
      %p But we need you to pay for those rewards before rewarding more. That way we can pay the creators you've supported. You can do that #{link_to "here", fund_rewards_path}.
      %p Thank you for your support!
