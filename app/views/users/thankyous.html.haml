%h1 Manage your Thank You Levels
%p
  Creator Thank You Levels are a way for you to say thanks when someone has shown you tremendous support.
  They're not required, but they are a good way to incentivize your followers to reward you more.
  After a supporter has rewarded you a certain amount (say, $50), you can give them something to say thanks.
  It can be as simple as access to a private blog article or as fancy as a custom painting. You choose the level of
  support that has to be reached and what you offer as thanks. We'll show this to others on your profile page and
  when they go to reward you.
