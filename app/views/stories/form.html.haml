    Mo&#149;meant stories are a new form of digital media. You simply take your creative content—whether it’s audio, video, text or images—and plug it into our customizable story blocks. The blocks allow you to layer and mash up content however you like. Hyperlinks give you an added dimension of interactivity.

    We’ve already got some great storytelling tools, but we’re always looking for feedback on how we can improve them and on what new tools you want to see. So get in touch with us!

          %p Start creating your story by clicking a slide. This will take you to the story builder, where you can choose a layout or template for the selected slide. Then, just follow the instructions to start filling in content. Once you've completed all ten slides, be sure to select one that can be used as a thumbnail. It will represent your story wherever it appears on the site and beyond. If you need more guidance, be sure to check out our tutorial here.
