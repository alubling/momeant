      %h1 Cashing Out
      %p Every time you reach $10.00 in rewards you may request a cashout.
      %p
        We pay cashouts once a month using Amazon WebPay.
        We send your earned rewards money to your Amazon account and you can withdraw it to your bank account free of charge.
        This allows you to get all of your money without us having to ask for your financial information.
