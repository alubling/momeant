  %p#explanation
    The web is a virtual economy, brimming with creative minds sharing and consuming information
    and content. With debt crises, automation and outsourcing causing upheavals in traditional
    markets around the world, the fate of the web depends on choices we make as members of this
    viral community. If we want to preserve a creative economy for the future, we must elevate
    the value we place on web content and the people producing it.
