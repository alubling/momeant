        Do you think the future of the Web is in paywalls and advertising?

        %span Neither do we.
    
    %p Right now, that future is being decided. Large publishers, bloggers, and media companies are pushing pay walls and advertising. They've decided to go back in time and resurrect old media models that haven't worked in the Web era.

    %h1 Why is this a problem?

    %ul
      %li
        %h3 Content is no longer made by a few massive corporations.
        %p Paywalls and advertising only work for the biggest players with the widest reach, and they cut everyone else out. We want to preserve equality on the Web for ALL content creators.
      %li
        %h3 We need a better way to support the creativity of everyone.
        %p The web has taught us that anyone can make great content. We need a simple way to voluntarily reward creators for their work, and we need your help to ensure a future in which all may prosper from content online.

        %h3 How is this different from a PayPal donate button?
        %p Building community is more powerful than any single transaction. Our goal is to go beyond the individual transaction, to aggregate all rewards from all users, and leverage those to build a community, an engaging experience, and stronger incentives that motivate people to reward.

      %li
        %h3 Why do we believe that content must be free?
        %p By allowing everyone to CHOOSE what to reward after viewing it, we have the power to decide what matters to us while only paying for the content (and creators) we care about.
    
      %li
        %h3 Why is this so important to the future of the Web?
        %p Paywalls and advertising only work for the biggest players with the widest reach, and cut everyone else out. By keeping pay voluntary and after the fact, we have a chance to build a new Creative Economy on the Web, where anyone can get paid for creating content. That's HUGE!
