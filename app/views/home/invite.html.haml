      %h2 Who can join?
      %p
        At the moment, we are recruiting creators by invitation only. In the future we will be expanding our creative community                         by asking active Mo&#149;meant creators to invite people whose work they know and love. That way, creative responsibility remains in the hands of the community itself, and our network of creators will develop organically, built on trust and personal relationships.

      %h2 But what about me?

        Well, we’re always ready to make an exception. If you’re interested in becoming a Mo&#149;meant creator, please provide us with your name, email address and a link to a sample of your work. We’d be glad to consider you!

      %p
        Try again. We’d be happy to look at more of your work in the future—particularly as we move out of beta and start to grow our creator community!
