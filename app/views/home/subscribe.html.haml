    .question
      %h2 How does my subscription fee get divvied up?
      %p
        Of your monthly $10, $3 goes into a view pool, which is evenly divided among all the creators
        whose content you view that month. (This helps support the larger Mo&#149meant community).
        The remaining $7 are credited to you as Mo&#149meant Coins (MCs). Use MCs to reward individual
        creators whose work you love.

    .question
      %h2 How does rewarding work?
      %p
        Seen a story you like? User your MCs to reward its creator. Each MC is worth about 10&cent;, and you can
        distribute them in denominations of 1, 2 or 5 &ndash; 5 being the maximum reward you can give
        a story per subscription cycle. Remember to choose wisely; when you reward a creator, you're speaking
        out on their behalf. That action becomes visible to the rest of the Mo&#149;meant community.

    .question
      %h2 What if I don't use my Mo&#149;meant Coins?
      %p
        If you have unspent MCs left over at the end of your monthly subscription cycle, we'll add them to a
        community pot. You &ndash; and the rest of the community &ndash; will decide together what it's for.
        For example, we can commission collaborations or new work from Mo&#149;meant creators, or fund community
        art projects that bridge the gap between the digital and the physical worlds.
