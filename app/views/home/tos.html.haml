  %h1 TERMS OF SERVICE

  %h2 SECTION 1 - GENERAL

  %h3 1.0 Acceptance of terms
  %p Welcome to Momeant.com, operated by Momeant Inc. ("MOMEANT", "we" or "us"). By using the services offered on or through www.momeant.com (the "Momeant Site") you are agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth below (the "Terms of Service" or "TOS"). We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time. You can always check out the most current version of these Terms of Service at this page.
  %p If you do not understand and agree to these Terms of Service, please do not use the Momeant Site or **any Services (as defined below)**, and do not register to be a member of MOMEANT. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, please let us know by contacting us here. Do not use the Services until these questions and concerns have been answered to your satisfaction, and you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service.

  %h3 1.1 Description of Service / Overview
  %p (This is what Momeant does, and defines the different roles of the site)
  %p Momeant is a community of Users ("Users" - those who view content and use the Site), and Creators ("Creators" - those Users who also choose to create or link content on the Site). Creators either create original Content on Momeant consisting of audio, video, text, and/or images, or link to existing Content that they have authored somewhere on the Web. Users view the Content, occasionally and voluntarily rewarding Creators using Momeant Reward Coins which are purchased through the Site.
  %p The Momeant site allows you to, among other things, upload, mash-up, link to, and share, audio, video, text, images, software and web sites; recommend "content" to other members; share links to "content" viewable on the Site on third party websites; "Reward" Creators using Momeant "Reward Coins" to adjust automated recommendations; post comments about "content"; invite other users and/or creators; purchase "Momeant Coins" on the Site; and use "Momeant Coins" to "reward" the Creators of Content (as more fully described below) (collectively, and together with the Site, the "Services" or, the "Service"). Unless otherwise stated, these Terms of Service apply to all Services. All content and additional or replacement services made available through the Momeant Site that were not made available as of the "Last Updated" date above shall automatically be deemed to be part of the "Services" when first made available through the Momeant Site. 

  %h3 1.2 Content
  %p (This section defines what constitutes Content, in its various forms. The bottom line is, content really can be anything: blog posts, videos, photo essays, journalism, software, even tweets or Facebook wall posts. When you create or link to content, you agree that you are the author of that content, otherwise you misrepresent yourself on our site, and we will remove you, return any rewards you've accrued, and possibly help the rightful authors of content take action against you. Please, for the sake of your fellow Creators, think about how you would feel and don't do it!).
  %p You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages and/or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted via the Service, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means that you, and not Momeant, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, link to, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. Momeant does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Momeant be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.
  %p By creating, posting, or linking Content via the Service, you agree that you are the rightful author of that Content and are allowed to represent yourself as such. In the case of creating original Content using Momeant's own Creation service, you acknowledge that you have the rights to re-purpose any text, audio, video, or photos that you insert into your original Content on the Site.
  %p You acknowledge that Momeant may or may not pre-screen Content, but that Momeant and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Momeant and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Momeant or submitted to Momeant, including without limitation information in all parts of the Service.
  %p You acknowledge, consent and agree that Momeant may access, preserve, and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Momeant, its users and the public.
  %p Momeant also restricts the posting of overtly commercial content on or via the Services. Overtly commercial content is content the primary purpose of which is to sell a product or services or induces Members to enroll in a promotional or money-making enterprise that may or may not be legitimate in nature. Momeant reserves the right to review and remove any overtly commercial content, at its sole discretion. Articles must provide legitimate informational and/or entertainment value for the community. For those seeking to promote legitimate commercial offers to the Momeant community, please contact our ad sales department ads@momeant.com.
  %p Momeant often allows Content to be posted that contains a link to free goods or services. Momeant always reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to remove all types of Content from the Service.

  %h3 1.3 Use of Services / Eligibility / Grant of License
  %p (This section covers who is eligible to agree to these terms, under what conditions, mostly regarding people under the age of 18 who want to use the site.

  %h3 1.4 Cancellation of accounts
  %p (We reserve the right to cancel or terminate your account if you violate our terms of service, or do something illegal or inappropriate. If that happens, we'll notify you and give you a chance to correct whatever your breach or violation is, and we'll pay out your rewards if necessary. If we cancel your account because you've been found to steal someone else's Content, or post or link to Content that you are not the other of and get Rewards from that, we'll boot you off the system and reimburse the Users who gave you any Rewards).
  %p You agree that MOMEANT may, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate your Momeant account, any associated email address, any associated username, and/or access to the Service. Cause for such termination shall include, but not be limited to, (i) breaches or violations of the TOS or other incorporated agreements, guidelines, policies or rules, (ii) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (iii) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, (iv) extended periods of inactivity, (v) your engagement in fraudulent or illegal activities, and/or (vi) nonpayment of any fees owed by you in connection with the Service. Termination of your Momeant account includes (a) removal of access to all offerings within the Service, (b) deletion of your password, username and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your account (or any part thereof), and (c) barring further use of the Service. Further, you agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in MOMEANT's sole discretion and that MOMEANT shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your account, any associated email address, username or access to the Service. In the event of the cancellation of your account, any outstanding rewards that are rightfully owed to you will be paid out during the next pay period. If the cancellation of your account is otherwise associated with a breach or violation of the terms such that you are not rightfully owed the outstanding rewards that have been given to you, Momeant will reimburse the Users who gave those Rewards during the next Pay Period from that date.

  %h3 1.5 Copyright
  %p (Copyright issues apply to Creators who create original stories on Momeant, using the site's Content Creation tools. In that case, you retain license and ownership over your Content and no other User can copy or re-use it in any way, which we will help enforce for you. If you are merely linking to Content that you have authored, copyright issues will likely not apply). 
  %p As a Creator on the Momeant Site, you retain license and ownership over all of your personally copyrighted content that you upload or insert into your originally created stories on Momeant. This Content cannot be copied and re-used by other Momeant creators in any way without your express written permission. If you see your copyrighted content in another creator's story without your permission and wish to take action, please email us immediately at copyright@momeant.com.
  %p MOMEANT respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our Users to do the same. MOMEANT may, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members and prohibit the use of the Service by certain users who may be repeat infringers.

  %h3 1.6 Appropriate conduct and member disputes
  %p (Momeant is a community of people trying to achieve a common purpose, please be respectful of others. Here are some legal definitions of the types of things that constitute inappropriate conduct in our community).
  %p Please read the following section carefully, as it governs your conduct while using the Momeant Site, and by using the Momeant Site, you agree to be bound by these terms. MOMEANT also strongly recommends that you review the Guidelines, for further clarification on what MOMEANT considers to be appropriate conduct on the Service.
  %p a. Appropriate Conduct. You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and communications while using the Momeant Site and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the Momeant Site only to send and receive messages and material that are legal and proper. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using the Momeant Site, you will not:

  %p b. Member Disputes. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Momeant Site Users. As a User, you are expected to tolerate viewpoints and perspectives with which you may not agree. MOMEANT is not obligated to arbitrate, or resolve in any manner, disputes that arise between Members. MOMEANT reserves the right but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Members, and to take any action, in MOMEANT's sole discretion, that may be appropriate under the circumstances. Such actions may include, but are not limited to the suspension or termination of memberships and the removal of inappropriate content.
  %p c. Reporting Objectionable Behavior. If you encounter Content or behavior that you think violates the TOS or Guidelines, you can report the incident to MOMEANT by flagging it where available, or by reporting it to support@momeant.com. Please state the reasons for your concern and provide a link to the Content or behavior in question.
  %p If the Content or behavior is determined to be inappropriate, then it is removed from the Momeant Site and the author is notified. All such determinations may be made at MOMEANT's sole discretion. MOMEANT may allow the author to modify the Content or change the behavior so that it is compliant with the TOS and Guidelines, and, assuming that it is, it may be subsequently released on the Momeant Site. MOMEANT reserves the right to terminate a Member's account at any time we determine that to be an appropriate response to the Content or behavior in question.


  %h2 SECTION 2 - CONTENT OWNERSHIP VS. AUTHORSHIP AND REWARDING - definitely read this section!

  %h3 2.1 Content Ownership vs. Authorship
  %p Creators are NOT required to own, but only to confirm and uphold legally if necessary, that they are the authors of their Content, when linking to that Content through Momeant or using the Reward "button" on their Content outside of Momeant. If you are the author of Content, and you are entitled and legally allowed to publicly state that you created it, that is all that is required in order to link to that Content, even if it occurs on a third party website, provided that it does not contradict the terms of your private agreement, if any, with the third party website. (Notice that this would actually be problematic for ghostwriters for instance, who can't claim authorship publicly).
  %p As a Creator, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, you are legally confirming your authorship of all Content that you create, post, or link through Momeant, or to which you attach the Momeant Reward button.You are further confirming your ability to publicly claim authorship and one of the following: 1) to link to the content in its unadulterated form wherever it exists on the Web, or 2) to re-publish the content in another medium (this requires ownership).
  %p When linking to a third party website where you've authored Content, Momeant actually refers directly to the original third party URL. Thus, Users are technically visiting the third party website, which allows Content to be unadulterated, getting the same traffic, hits, impressions, and advertising revenue as it would ordinarily. 
  %p Creators are only required to own the rights to the Content that they submit, or to have the right to use the Content they submit, when they are creating original Content on Momeant using the Momeant content creator. 

  %h3 2.2 Rewarding
  %p Momeant Rewards DO NOT in any way constitute payments for Content. Content is always free on Momeant, and Content creators retain all rights or privileges to their own Content. Rewards are voluntary donations which show appreciation and support to an actual author of Content. 

  %h2 SECTION 3 - PAYMENT TERMS
  %p (This section contains our payment terms for both Users purchasing Reward Coins to reward, and Creators getting paid out from their rewards. While the terms reflect that we want to reasonably protect ourselves from fraud and other financial liabilities, we will always do our best to work with both Users and Creators to find reasonable solutions to your issues. We're a small company, you just have to ask us, we want to help). 

  %h3 3.0 Momeant costs / rates
  %p Each Reward coin used to reward creators has a value of $0.10. A small percentage of each coin purchase is used to cover credit card transaction fees and other costs that go directly to third parties, which vary depending on the type of card used, etc. Additionally, Momeant charges 10% of pay out transactions to Creators to pay for its costs and the ongoing support, growth, and innovation of the product and community.   

  %h3 3.1 Change In Rates or fees
  %p Momeant may from time to time change its rates or fee structure, at its sole discretion. (We're currently working on simplifying the process by which reward coins are purchased, and there will be an email and site-wide notification to update our users)

  %h3 3.2 Content on Momeant is made freely available.
  %p All Creators realize that Users are freely able to view, consume and engage with Content and have the option to offer a reward at their own discretion and at an amount of their choosing including zero.

  %h3 3.3 User Payments
  %p Purchases on the Momeant Site are defined as the purchasing of "Momeant Coin Packages", a currency valid only within the Momeant Site (Momeant "Reward Coins"), in allotments of $5, $10, and $20 and $100 USD. By purchasing Reward Coins, Users receive currency within the Momeant Site that they can thereby use to reward individual pieces of content at their own discretion.
  %p Momeant currently processes payments using Amazon's Flexible Payments Service. Momeant is solely responsible for its own Services and the parts of the payment transaction that we handle, which is the information leading up to a transaction. Momeant is not liable, and cannot take responsibility, for any parts of the payment transaction controlled by Amazon FPS. Momeant will, however, to the best of our ability, help our Users who have issues with Amazon FPS to resolve those issues successfully either within Amazon or using another payment service.  
  %p You agree that you will pay for all products and/or services you purchase through the Momeant Site, and that MOMEANT may charge your credit card for any products and/or services purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and processing fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing MOMEANT with a valid credit card for payment of all fees. All fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the registration and/or transaction process. If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online in the payment transaction section of the Momeant Site; this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Momeant Site while MOMEANT verifies your payment information. 
  %p All sales of products and/or services are final. All sales of Momeant Reward Coins are final. Refunds and returns that are granted by MOMEANT will be solely and exclusively in the form of Momeant Reward Coins. MOMEANT will return Reward Coins in instances in which the Creators rewarded are found to have misrepresented their authorship of Content. Prices for products and/or services offered via the Momeant Site may change at any time, and the Momeant Site does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or change of any kind. If a product and/or service becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to delivery, your sole remedy is a refund. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product and/or service, your exclusive and sole remedy is refund of the price paid, as determined by MOMEANT. 

  %h3 3.4 Creator Payment Process and timeframe
  %p As a Creator, each time you reach $10 of reward coins received, you are eligible for a pay out. Once the threshold is reached an email and site notification will indicate to you that you are eligible for a pay out. In order to initiate the pay out process, you must go into your profile and select "cash out" from the main page, which will initiate the payment process at the next Pay Period ("Pay Period" = the end of that month). Payments to Creators will be made no later than thirty business days after the end of a Pay Period, which is to be no longer than three calendar months. (Note: this is in case of fraudulent activity, like falsely claiming to author someone else's content, in which case it will take us some time to verify authorship and deliver payment. Ordinarily payment will happen very shortly after the end of the pay period). Momeant currently pays out rewards using Amazon, PayPal and traditional checks as payment services. 

  %h3 3.5 Potential copyright infringement
  %p If Momeant receives a User submission of a potential copyright infringement or dispute about content that a creator has uploaded onto the Momeant site, Momeant reserves the right to withhold payment for an indefinite period of time beyond the standard payment period, until the dispute is deemed adequately resolved by Momeant or whatever service provider represents Momeant in such claims.

  %h3 3.6 Cookies and Other Personal Information
  %p As a User and Creator, you agree and acknowledge that in order to provide the Services and Product, Momeant shall have the right to collect information about you, without limitation, via cookies and recorded data from Momeant's servers and/or partners. Momeant will not sell your information to any outside third parties, and it will only be used to provide you with the Services and Product stated in this agreement. We also will ensure that any personal information intended to be private (as in, not publicly available on Momeant) will be kept strictly private, including from other Users and Creators. 

  %h3 3.7 Privacy Disclaimer
  %p By using this Site, Users and/or Creators acknowledge and agree that Internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. As a User and/or Creator you acknowledge and understand that any message and/or information sent to Momeant may be read and/or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a particular transaction or transmission (for example, credit card information) is encrypted.

  %h3 3.8 Taxes, Interest and/or IRS Penalties
  %p As a Creator, you hereby acknowledge that you are fully responsible for any and all taxes, interest and penalties arising from receipt of any Payment from Momeant. In addition to the general indemnification granted elsewhere by you to Momeant, you hereby agree to indemnify and hold Momeant, its officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors-in-interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates, harmless from any and all demands, losses, liabilities, claims and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs), made against Momeant by any third party due to, or arising out of, and/or in connection with Provider's uses of the Site.


  %h2 SECTION 4 - RESPONSIBILITY OF CREATOR FOR CONTENT
  %p (Essentially, and its no surprise, you are responsible for your own content. So make it amazing, but please don't do anything inappropriate)

  %h3 4.0 Creator costs
  %p Creator agrees to and shall be responsible for any costs, attorneys' fees, costs and/or damages incurred or assessed against Momeant and its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives because of and/or arising out of any action taken in response to, and/or suggested by, Creator's Content, including, but not limited to, suggestions and/or or inducements that a listener should and/or engage in any illegal, unsafe, scandalous, obscene, libelous or morally deviant and/or otherwise inappropriate behavior. 
  %p 4.0.1 Creator agrees to and shall indemnify and hold harmless Momeant (and its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives), and Creator agrees to and shall pay any defense costs, attorneys' fees and costs as well as any and all damages and/or payments assessed against Momeant on account of any illegal, unsafe, scandalous, obscene, libelous, morally deviant and/or otherwise inappropriate material contained in Creator's Content.

  %h3 4.1 Momeant shall not be responsible for editing any Content
  %p Momeant also retains the right, in its sole discretion and judgment, to delete and/or decline to use any Content that in Momeant's opinion is illegal, unsafe, scandalous, obscene, libelous, morally deviant and/or otherwise of an inappropriate nature.

  %h3 4.2 Infringement Claims
  %p Creator agrees and warrants that Creator shall immediately notify Momeant, in writing to the notice address listed herein, if any claim of infringement, obscenity, incitement, and/or any other legal action is brought against Creator in connection with any Content, including, without limitation, any claim pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 3.6.

  %h3 4.3 This Agreement is personal to Creator
  %p Creator may not assign and/or otherwise transfer Creator's rights and duties under this Agreement without prior written notice to Momeant and written consent of Momeant. Any such purported assignment without such notification is null and void.


  %h2 SECTION 5 - INDEMNIFICATION, TERMINATION, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  %p (this section covers how we deal with Users or Creators that join in order to spam our legitimate Users).

  %h3 5.0 Termination and Modification
  %p In addition to any other rights or remedies available to it, MOMEANT reserves the right to immediately suspend, terminate, access and investigate the user account of any user upon receipt of a subpoena or law enforcement request, or when MOMEANT believes, in its sole discretion, that a user is transmitting or is otherwise connected with the distribution of unsolicited bulk email messages (SPAM) or any harassing email messages, comments, or posts, or with any fraudulent, misleading, illegal or otherwise objectionable activities. Because of the difficulty associated with quantifying damages, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you agree to pay MOMEANT liquidated damages of $5 for each piece of unsolicited bulk email transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account or the maximum liquidated damages permitted under law, whichever is greater; otherwise you agree to pay MOMEANT's actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
  %p You agree that MOMEANT, in its sole and absolute discretion, may terminate your password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services, and remove and discard any Submission(s) or other content within the Services, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if MOMEANT believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Terms of Service. MOMEANT may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that MOMEANT may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Services. Further, you agree that MOMEANT shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Services.
  %p The provisions of these Terms of Service pertaining to disclaimers, exclusion of damages, limitations of liability and indemnification shall survive termination.

  %h3 5.1 Indemnification

  %h2 SECTION 7 - NOTICES
  %h3 7.1 Technical Errors Not a Material Breach
  %p It is hereby acknowledged and agreed to by the Parties that the Internet is sometimes unreliable, slow and/or inactive. As such, the Parties agree that Momeant shall not be responsible for any delays and/or errors in fulfilling orders for Provider's Content caused by Momeant's Internet connection, equipment (including server) failure, distributors and/or delivery services and/or by Acts of God, and/or any other cause beyond the control of Momeant. Momeant shall not be responsible for any failure to list the submitted Content due to transmission errors and/or any other cause beyond the control of Momeant.

  %h3 7.2 Momeant Compliance Notice
  %p All pictures, graphics, videos or other visual media displayed on the Momeant Site are exempt from the provision of 18 U.S.C. section 2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75 because said visual media do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. section 2256 (2) (A) through (D), but are merely depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995.
  %p The owners and operators of the Momeant Site are not the primary producer (as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. section 2257 or subsequent case law defining such) of any of the visual content contained in the Momeant Site.


  %h2 SECTION 8 - COMPLETION AND ALTERATION

  %h3 8.0 Inadvertent/Minor Errors Not a Material Breach
  %p It is hereby acknowledged and agreed to by the Parties that, although Momeant uses its best efforts to accurately account, there may be minor, inadvertent accounting errors due to the number of transactions processed by Momeant, coupled with the fractional dollar amount of many of these transactions. Provider will have the right to request, not more than once per calendar year and at Provider's sole expense, an audit of Momeant's records to verify the accuracy of Momeant's accounting in regard to Provider's Content ("Audit Request"). Such Audit Request is subject to Momeant's agreement, which may be withheld in Momeant's sole discretion and judgment. Should Provider's request be granted by Momeant in its sole discretion and judgment, an audit will occur at the place where Momeant maintains such records, during Momeant's normal business hours and with at least thirty (30) calendar days prior notice. In the event that accounting errors are found, Momeant reserves the right to address and rectify the alleged errors within fifteen (15) business days. Any audit, objection relating to any accounting statement, and/or claim arising therefrom, must be made (and claim, mediation and/or lawsuit commenced) no later than one (1) calendar year after the date of the Pay Period in question. Provider hereby waives any longer statute of limitations that may be permitted by law. Provider agrees that in the event Provider brings legal action against Momeant for a purported breach of the Agreement due to a failure to provide an accurate accounting, and a financial review or audit of Momeant's books and records yields a finding that the difference between the accounting provided by Momeant to Provider and the auditor's findings is five percent (5%) or less, then Provider agrees to reimburse Momeant for Momeant's actual attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements incurred in connection with the Provider's action and/or audit.

  %p Each individual signing this Agreement (either on paper or electronically), whether signed individually or on behalf of any person and/or entity, warrants and represents that the individual has full authority to so execute this Agreement on behalf of the Party on whose behalf he or she signs. Each of the Parties separately acknowledges and represents that this representation and warranty is accurate and is an essential and material provision of this Agreement and shall survive the execution of this Agreement.
